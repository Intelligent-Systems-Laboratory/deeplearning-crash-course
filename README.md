# Deep Learning  Crash Course

This crash course believes in three philosophies:

The first one is:
> We learn by doing

Thus, we emphasize this philosophy by hopefully doing everything as hands-on as possible.

The second one is: 
> We are our best teachers

This means that we learn best when we learn it on our own. Based on my twenty six years of existence, the best learners I have met learns by exploring it on their own. They pursue knowledge for knowledge sake. 

Hence, in this workshop, what we want to emphasize is that the materials should be exploratory on its own. You are actually encouraged to use more reference material other than the ones contained here. 

In corollary to this, as most of the best materials are in text format. This course focuses on you becoming a reader. 

The third one is:
> We will never be ready

This means that you don't need so much pre-requisites to learn something new. 

Thus, the following are not a valid excuse:  
- *"Oh! I never learn python, so I can't do the exercise."*
- *"I am not good in programming, so this is too fast. I can't do it. "*
- *"I can't do this. How can I do it without having formal lectures?"*

The point here is as long as you can do three things:      
(1) Use your laptop for reading and writing,    
(2) Use your mouse/trackpad for navigating on your screen   
(3) Type something using your keyboard,    

then you can do it!

Last but not the least, I just want to pre-empt you that you might feel very uncomfortable as there's so many complicated things to learn in one sitting. 

So, I just want to let you know:   
**"Welcome to the world of software development... where every thing is complicated!"**

**Carpe Diem!!**

## Day 2 - Machine Learning and Neural Networks

### Recap of Reading List:

Let's have a brief exercise.  Click the link below:    
[Reading Exercise](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aJrqm4d6oKwl1sIBSjnBMf2bspy99bYt53szzGQHBfE/edit?usp=sharing)

### Machine Learning Big Picture
Now that we have fresh slate of the concepts. Let's go slightly deeper. We start off by focusing first on the big picture:

1. Click on the link below:    
[Machine Learning Playground](http://ml-playground.com/#)


2. Try to play around to understand the different capabilities of different models. 
If you don't know how to start. You can use our four sample dataset as seen in our folder ml-playground-sample-data as enumerated below:    
    a.  simple data   
    b.  circular data   
    c.  spiral data   
    d.  xor data 

### Machine Learning End-to-End Cycle
In Day 1, we started off to get familiar with Machine Learning from start to finish with the help of looking other people's work. This is done thru kaggle.
For today, given your newly equipped concepts and skills. Let's try to look at an end-to-end ML Project again.

Questions So Far?
Revisiting concepts:
1. Why do we do Train / Test Split?
2. What is the meaning of overfit and underfit? What is therefore the Bias/Variance Trade-off?
3. How do we ensure reproducibility of results? In other words, how do we ensure that we would have the same result when re-run our training?


### Revisiting Our Optimizer

[02 Stochastic Gradient Descent](02_sgd.ipynb)

Revisiting Concepts:
1. What is the meaning of epochs?
2. How significant is our learning rate?
3. How do we measure on how "fit" is our best fit line? 
4. From #3, In general, this is called ____ function.



We're done. Congrats! Let's have a break.

If you haven't watched the threeBlueOneBrown videos as stated in day 2 Readings. You have time to catch up during the break.
