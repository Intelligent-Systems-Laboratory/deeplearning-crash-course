# Deep Learning  Crash Course

This crash course believes in three philosophies:

The first one is:
> We learn by doing

Thus, we emphasize this philosophy by hopefully doing everything as hands-on as possible.

The second one is: 
> We are our best teachers

This means that we learn best when we learn it on our own. Based on my twenty six years of existence, the best learners I have met learns by exploring it on their own. They pursue knowledge for knowledge sake. 

Hence, in this workshop, what we want to emphasize is that the materials should be exploratory on its own. You are actually encouraged to use more reference material other than the ones contained here. 

In corollary to this, as most of the best materials are in text format. This course focuses on you becoming a reader. 

The third one is:
> We will never be ready

This means that you don't need so much pre-requisites to learn something new. 

Thus, the following are not a valid excuse:  
- *"Oh! I never learn python, so I can't do the exercise."*
- *"I am not good in programming, so this is too fast. I can't do it. "*
- *"I can't do this. How can I do it without having formal lectures?"*

The point here is as long as you can do three things:      
(1) Use your laptop for reading and writing,    
(2) Use your mouse/trackpad for navigating on your screen   
(3) Type something using your keyboard,    

then you can do it!

Last but not the least, I just want to pre-empt you that you might feel very uncomfortable as there's so many complicated things to learn in one sitting. 

So, I just want to let you know:   
**"Welcome to the world of software development... where every thing is complicated!"**

**Carpe Diem!!**

## Day 1 Homework and Day 2 Readings

Objective:  understand more concepts learned in day 1
### Getting Started

### Day 1 Homework
You have two options here.
#### Option 1: Submit to other Competition. (more comfortable, harder)
- If you chose Titanic, submit an entry to Housing Price Dataset

#### Option 2: Improve your score to the competition you chose (less comfortable, simpler)
- Get at least 1% gain in your current score, that's already okay.

#### Option 3: Finish all Day 1 Morning Exercise (simplest)
-  Just try to finish all Data Analysis Day 1 Morning Exercise

##### Additional Reference:
[Data Science Summary](https://github.com/ShuaiW/data-science-question-answer#statistics-and-ml-in-general) - I like this one as it summarizes everything you need to know

### Day 2 Readings
#### Read Chapter 1 and 2 on [Hands-on Machine Learning by Auréllien Géron](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15angXfk0k3Q0k_ae4VBddBRkl5cExPTS?usp=sharing)
[![geron](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511IU--e4%2BL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)]((https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15angXfk0k3Q0k_ae4VBddBRkl5cExPTS?usp=sharing))
- For convenience, you can [click here for a copy](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15angXfk0k3Q0k_ae4VBddBRkl5cExPTS?usp=sharing)


Note: This book has hands-on notebook you can fiddle with:   

[Chapter 1 The Machine Learning Landscape](./01_the_machine_learning_landscape.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/01_the_machine_learning_landscape.ipynb)

[Chapter 2 End to End Machine Learning Project](./02_end_to_end_machine_learning_project.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/02_end_to_end_machine_learning_project.ipynb)

Tip: You can use our `deeplearning` environment in jupyterlab to run all his codes.

#### New Feature: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb) 

1. If you haven't setup your laptop. You can click on [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb) beside each exercise so that you won't have to setup anything. Colab is a free cloud-based Jupyter notebook sponsored by Google.

2. Afterwards, Click File > Save a copy in Drive. So that you can edit and run it, and it is automatically saved in your Google Drive > My Drive > Colab Notebook

3. Lastly, Change/Verify your Runtime. Click Runtime > Change Runtime Type. It should have the ff:   
    Runtime Type: Python 3   
    Hardware Accelerator: TPU
