# Deep Learning  Crash Course

## Overview:

This crash course believes in the ff philosophy:

> We learn by doing

Thus, we emphasize this philosophy by hopefully doing everything as hands-on as possible.

> We are best teachers to ourselves

This means that we learn best when we learn it on our own. Based on my twenty six years of existence, the best learners I have met learns on their own. They pursue knowledge for knowledge sake. 

Hence, in this workshop, what we want to emphasize is that the materials should exploratory on its own. You are actually encouraged not to follow the guidelines below. 

In corollary to this, as most of the best materials are in text format. This course focuses on you becoming a reader. 

## Day 1: Data Science and Data Manipulation using Python

### A. Prerequisites:   
1. Day 0   
2. Prior Readings: Bash Script


### B. 10am - 1pm: Intro to Python and its Data Science Toolpack

**Your Mission: Complete all exercises**

Expected Outcome:   
- Familiarize on python   
- Implement and run your own python codes   
- work your way on your new environment   
- Familiarize with the data science tools   


#### Gettings Started
Open your terminal, afterwards you should see something like this

Pre-requisites:    
This repo assumes you have the ff package:   
- git   
- Anaconda   


#### Tutorials: Basic Python and Data Science

Always remember the creed:
> *learn on the fly*

Thus, these materials are organized for you to get more comfortable for solving the exercises.
